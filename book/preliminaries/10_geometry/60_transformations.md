Required Reading: The following assumes a working familiarity with 2D and 3D Cartesian reference frames. If you are not familiar with Cartesian reference frames, please read the [chapter on reference frames](#reference_frames). Some familiarity with [linear alegra](#linear_algebra) is also helpful.

## Introduction

_Transformations_ are functions that map points to other points in space, i.e. $f: X \rightarrow X$. These maps are useful for describing motions over time. A particularly important class of transformations are _linear transformations_. These transformations can be represented by square matrices as they are _linear_ and has the same domain and image.

## Definitions and important examples

Please refer to the _Robotics Handbook_ section 1.2, and in the context of this course, reader's goal is to attain a conceptual understanding, not necessarily knowing the exact formulae.

TODO: we need to provide links to the handbook. -AC

## Applications

TODO: adapt the concepts in the context of Duckietown.
